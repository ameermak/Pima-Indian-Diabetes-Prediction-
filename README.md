# Pima-Indian-Diabetes-Prediction-

Driven by a personal connection to the challenges of diabetes within my family, I took on a machine learning initiative to predict the likelihood of individuals developing diabetes. Using the Pima Indian diabetes dataset from Kaggle, I dove into the project armed with Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-Learn, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

The journey involved a careful approach to data pre-processing. I tackled tasks like identifying and removing irrelevant features using a graphical correlation matrix, adjusting datatypes strategically, and handling missing values while ensuring data integrityâ€”given the significance of over 50% of the training data. Aiming for a 70% accuracy target, I explored different algorithms, starting with Naive Bayes for its simplicity and stability, navigating through the complexities of Random Forest, and finally finding success with logistics regression.

Refinements included integrating cross-validation (K-folds) to fine-tune hyperparameters, ensuring adaptability and performance across diverse data subsets. Although the final model didn't quite hit the 70% target, it stands as proof of my commitment to addressing health challenges with a meticulous and data-driven approach.
